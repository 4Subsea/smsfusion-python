    seed : int, optional

) -> NDArray[np.float64]:
    """
    Generates a discrete-time (bandlimited) Gaussian white noise sequence.

    Bandlimited white noise is characterized by a spectral amplitude which is
    constant over the bandwidth, and zero outside that range. I.e.,:

        S(w) = N ** 2,  for ``|w|`` <= 2*pi*W

        S(w) = 0,       for ``|w|`` > 2*pi*W

    where `W = fs / 2` is the bandwidth in hertz, and `N` is the spectral
    density coefficient.

    The returned white sequence will thus have a variance of `N ** 2 * fs`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : float
        Spectral density coefficient.
    fs : float
        Sampling frequency in Hz.
    n : int
        Number of samples to generate.

    Returns
    -------
    x : numpy.ndarray
        Discrete time Gaussian white noise sequence.

def random_walk(

) -> NDArray[np.float64]:
    """
    Generates a discrete-time random walk (i.e., Brownian noise) sequence.

    The random walk process is characterized by a power spectrum:

        S(w) = K ** 2 / w ** 2

    where `K` is the spectral density coefficient, and `w` is the angular
    frequency.

    A discrete-time realization of the process is generated by the recursive
    equation:

        X[k+1] = X[k] + W[k]

    with `W[k]` being a zero-mean Gaussian white noise sequence with standard
    deviation:

        sigma_wn = K / sqrt(fs)

    The sequence starts always at 0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    K : float
        Spectral density coefficient.
    fs : float
        Sampling frequency in Hz.
    n : int
        Number of samples to generate.

    Return

) -> NDArray[np.float64]:
    """
    Generates a discrete-time first-order Gauss-Markov sequence.

    The first-order Gauss-Markov process is characterized by a power spectrum:

        S(w) = 2 * sigma**2 * beta / (w**2 + beta**2)

    where `sigma` is the long-term standard deviation of the process,
    `tau_c = 1 / beta` is the correlation time, and `w` is the angular
    frequency.

    A discrete-time realization of the process is generated by the recursive
    equation (see reference [1]_):

        X[k+1] = exp(-beta * dt) * X[k] + W[k]

    with `W[k]` being a zero-mean Gaussian white noise sequence with standard
    deviation:

        sigma_wn = sigma * sqrt(1 - exp(-2 * beta * dt))

    The sequence starts always at 0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sigma : float
        Standard deviation (i.e., root-mean-square value) of the process.
    tau_c : float
        Correlation time in seconds.
    fs : float
        Sampling frequency in Hz.
    n : int
        Number of samples to generate.

    Return
    ------
    x : numpy.ndarray
        Discrete-time first-order Gauss-Markov sequence.
